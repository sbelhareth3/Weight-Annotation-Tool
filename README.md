# Weight Annotation Tool

This is a tool that allows you to view certain observations from sample patients whose information is available on launch.smarthealthit.org
Using this repo's launch.html, you can deploy this SMART-on-FHIR application, and add annotations to weight observations for the patient you choose.

Various pieces of open-source code were used for this project. All credit is given in the READMEs in the directories for each portion of open-source code used.
